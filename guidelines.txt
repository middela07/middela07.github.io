Page Layout
• Visual organization is easily understood
	We created a template page and used it as a landing page (home page).
• Aesthetic use of colors and fonts
	We have created a css file that standardized the website with consistent colors, images, fonts, and spacing.
• Consistent format page to page
	This template page that we created will follow the standard format of every page included on our website.

Navigational Theme
• Links present and working
	We have created a header and footer page so that links are consistent thrughout the website
• Links show consistent formatting
	We have formatted the links in our codes by using a "link rel" tag, which specifies the item as a link
• Navigational path is clear and logical
	The paths to navigate each section are easy click links, and we have 

 Graphic Media Use
• Enhances topic
	(show solar page) each image, like the applications, exemplifies the content, like solar panel fused in windows 
• Creativity through graphic design
(template, code, or combined)
	By using css, you can see the image size formatted;like the corner images fit smaller than the middle ones for an aestetic balanced look. CSS allows us to change it. In specificity...(insert code)  
• Originality of graphics (stock or original)
	
	
• Effective use of innovative technology
(Ex: original coding, use of SASS, Python)
	Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, 
	For the structure, we have created an HTML template to make the format consistent across the website. 
	The color combinations, images, fonts, and other design elements are personalized with CSS, 
	which we made from scratch. And, with Bootstrap, we could make our website responsive to the user's device.
	
	We have written our code in an editor called Sublime Text 3. By individually designing each page, 
	but using the checkin and checkout of the code from the GITHUB-which holds the source code,
	we could combine our work into one stunning website.
