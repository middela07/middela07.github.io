    <p>Geothermal is a source of energy which is accessed from inside the Earth’s surface. The internal heat of the Earth comes from the heated magma, rocks, and fluids. The energy can be captured by a system of geothermal heat pumps that collect heat from the first 10 feet, or 3 meters, of the Earth to regulate the air and water temperature in a home as well as generate electricity.

      <h3>Pros</h3>
      <p class="w3-opacity">24/7 Heating</p>
      <p>The benefits of a geothermal home include the ability to use the energy 24/7. This is due to the fact that Earth is internally always heated, unlike solar or wind energy where you need to rely on the weather for your needs. 
      <p class="w3-opacity">Fossil Fuel Emmisions</p>
      Also, no fossil fuels, like coal, oil, or natural gas, are burnt or used. The emission by geothermal power plants release about 99% less carbon dioxide emissions than the power plants for fossil fuels that are of similar size. </p>

  <!-- CONS Section -->

      <img src="./images/quake.jpg" alt="ConsImage" style="width:100%">
      <h3>Cons</h3>
      <p class="w3-opacity">Surface Instablity</p>
      <p>The disadvantages of a geothermal home include the problem of surface instability. The building of geothermal power plants have been known to cause earthquakes, like the earthquake which occured in Switzerland in 1997 that reached a magnitude of 3.4 on the Ritcher scale. 
      <p class="w3-opacity">Location Specific</p>
      In addition, geothermal energy is very location specific. For example, the places with the most heat in the US are located in the west/midwest, where hot springs and geothermal reservoirs are located. This can only be helpful if you live nearby and are able to pump the energy directly into your home. Locations further are more difficult to preserve and distribute the heat to.</p>

      <img src="./images/geoapp.jpg" alt="AppImage" style="width:100%"  height:100px>
      <h3>Application</h3>
      <p class="w3-opacity">Air conditioning</p>
      <p> Geothermal energy is applied to daily life in majority for heating. With water pumps under the ground, heated water can enter into the air conditioning system to heat your home, or it can be directly used for baths and sinks. 
      <p class="w3-opacity">Large Areas</p>
      Sometimes, geothermal energy can even be used to heat entire cities; the city of Reykjavik in Iceland, used heated water pumped from nearby hot springs and geothermal reservoirs. The city of Klamath Falls, Ore, pumps heated water underneath it’s streets and crosswalks to melt the abundance of snow that causes problems for the city.</p>

      <h3>Costs</h3>
      <p class="w3-opacity">Money</p>
      <p>Most of the money needed for geothermal energy is for paying for the geothermal field and power plant, which is about $2500 for each kW installed, and about $0.01 to $0.03 to operate and maintain per kW. 
      <p class="w3-opacity">Best Placement</p>
